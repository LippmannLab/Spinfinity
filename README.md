# Spinfinity

Spinfinity touchscreen program that allows for 8 spinning bioreactors to be used simultaneously. 

Three-dimensional (3D) brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), have become a powerful system to study early development events and to model human disease . Cerebral organoids are generally produced in static culture or in a culture vessel with active mixing, and the two most widely used systems for mixing are a large spinning flask and a miniaturized multi-well spinning bioreactor (also known as Spin Omega. The Spin Omega provides a system that is amenable to drug testing, has increased throughput and reproducibility, and utilizes less culture media. However, technical limitations of this system include poor stability of select components and an elevated risk of contamination due to the overall setup of the device. Here, we report a new design of the miniaturized bioreactor system, which we term Spinꝏ, that overcomes these concerns to permit long-term experiments.

## Installation and Usage 
1. Turn on Raspberry Pi system and op the command terminal. 
2. Type the following text in the command line: git clone https://github.com/LippmannLab/Spinfinity.git
3. Enter: cd /home/pi/Spinfinity
4. A new line should read: pi@raspberrypi:~Spinfinity $
5. Enter python 5Motors.py
6. The Spinfinity touchscreen program should should. If the Raspberry Pi is restarted, then open the command terminal again and re-enter steps 3-5 to open the program.
